# BRB-seq Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive BRB-seq analysis pipeline implemented using Snakemake. The pipeline processes bulk RNA barcoding and sequencing (BRB-seq) data through quality control, alignment, and quantification stages to produce gene expression counts ready for downstream analysis.

## Pipeline Stages

The pipeline consists of three main stages:

1. **Quality Control (QC)**: Assesses the quality of raw sequencing data
2. **Alignment**: Maps raw reads to a reference genome
3. **Feature Counts**: Quantifies gene expression by counting reads mapped to genomic features

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TheSaezAtienzarLab/osc-brbseq-pipeline.git
cd osc-brbseq-pipeline

# Configure samples in resources/config/metasheet.csv
# Configure parameters in resources/config/params.yaml

# Run the pipeline
snakemake --cores <N> --use-conda
```

- MultiQC
- STAR
- Samtools
- Subread (for featureCounts)
- Python (≥ 3.6)

## Key Features

### What is BRB-seq?

BRB-seq (Bulk RNA Barcoding and sequencing) is an ultra-high-throughput 3' mRNA-seq technology that:
- Uses early-stage sample barcoding and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)
- Allows pooling of up to 384 samples early in the workflow
- Generates reads only from the 3' region of mRNA molecules
- Requires lower sequencing depth (1-5 million reads per sample vs 30 million for standard RNA-seq)
- Is cost-effective for large-scale transcriptomic studies
- Has greater tolerance for lower RNA quality
- Uses forward-stranded library preparation (strand specificity = 1)

### Quality Control
- FastQC analysis of raw reads
- MultiQC reporting for easy comparison

### Alignment
- STAR alignment optimized for BRB-seq single-end reads
- BAM indexing and metrics collection
- MultiQC reporting of alignment statistics

### Feature Counts
- Gene expression quantification with featureCounts
- Forward-stranded counting mode (strand specificity = 1)
- Merged count matrix generation
- CPM normalization
- MultiQC reporting of counting statistics

```

Replace `<N>` with the number of cores to use.

### Running Specific Stages

The workflow supports running individual stages:

```
# Run just the QC stage
snakemake --cores <N> qc_all

# Run just the alignment stage
snakemake --cores <N> align_all

# Run just the feature counts stage
snakemake --cores <N> count_all
```

For HPC environments, you can use the provided cluster configuration:

```
snakemake --profile slurm --cluster-config resources/config/cluster.yaml
```

Or with explicit cluster parameters:

```
snakemake --cluster "sbatch --mem={resources.mem_mb} --time={params.time} --cpus-per-task={threads}" --jobs 100
```
